  - Prepare pycharm env with python 3.3 and latest TensorFlow
  - Very naive implmentation with the same data as CS20SI
  - Compare the two bots

- Find a best way to record trial and error
  - model parameters (do we have to keep all the parameter files?)
  - How we construct model
  - Maybe tag or release?
  - Think what should be done while training? Read papers?
- Tune model
  - Make a list of tuning points
  - BEAM search
  - Re-read http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs20si/assignments/a3.pdf and make a list of todo again
- Make it work in English
- Make it work in Japanese
- Make tweet bot
